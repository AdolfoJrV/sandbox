      <h4>
        <a href="crime_stats.html" >Crime Statistics</a>
      </h4>
      <p>
        Data is provided monthly by the Calgary Police Service. This data is
        considered cumulative as late-reported incidents are often received well
        after an offence has occurred. Therefore, crime counts are subject to
        change as they are updated. Crime count is based on the most serious
        violation (MSV) per incident. Violence: These figures include all
        violent crime offences as defined by the Centre for Canadian Justice
        Statistics Universal Crime Reporting (UCR) rules. Domestic violence is
        excluded.
